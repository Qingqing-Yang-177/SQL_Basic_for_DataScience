# SQL_for_DataScience

md files are basic codes as a guidance, but code syntax varies in different relational database management systems,

md files and some SQL files are based on SQLite management systems [SQLite Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/index.htm);

while some other SQL files are based on MySql 0.4.0 management tool extension, MySql server 8.0.27, Oracle management systems on VSCode

The database that I'm using is from [Chinook-database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database)

Check and search for the codes in stackoverflow with keyword: Statement, RDBMS
